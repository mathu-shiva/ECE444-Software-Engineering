## Pros and Cons of TDD

### Pros
* With TDD, users will write high quality code from the get-go, as they are already writing the code with the aim of the specific test case to pass.
* Any issues and bugs can be detected and addressed early on in the development process. This will help ensure we do not carry forward this error into other chunks of the code base.
* With TDD, code refactoring becomes much more simplified. With frequent testing, we can easily identify which chunk of code is causing the error, eradicating the fear of messing up other chunks of code causing any unexpected errors.

### Cons
* TDD may be time consuming. Writing code so that it addresses the specific of many tests can be more time consuming than just writing code with one given purpose in mind. It can be more time-consuming to those unfamiliar with this development style.
* TDD may lead to over-testing which can cause development to be over complicated. If we write tests prior, we might write too many detailed tests, some of which we do not need. Coding with all of these restrictions can become much more complicated.
